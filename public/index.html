<div>
  <h1>Hello World, from ordinary HTML!</h1>
  <p>React is going to leave me alone.</p>
  <p>You can't (straightforwardly) change me from your React code!</p>
</div>
<hr />
<div id="arbitrarily-named-target">
  <h1>I should not survive React's interference!</h1>
  <p>
    My React app will get <i>rendered</i> into the parent of this div,
    overwriting all of its contents!
  </p>
</div>
<hr />
<div id="differently-named-target">
  <h1>I should survive React's interference!</h1>
  <p>My React app will get <i>rendered</i> into a different div tag.</p>
  <p>But this is boring old HTML - no dynamic JavaScripting happening here.</p>
  <p>So this is tedious to change:</p>
  <p>How much would could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?</p>
